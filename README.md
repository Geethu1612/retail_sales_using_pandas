ðŸ›’ Retail Sales Data Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Objective
Analyze retail sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using Python and Pandas, and visualize the results through charts.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
    Python

    Pandas (data manipulation)

    Matplotlib(visualization)

    Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
We used a Retail Sales Dataset containing the following columns:

    Transaction ID â€“ Unique identifier for each transaction

    Date â€“ Date of the purchase

    Customer ID â€“ Unique ID of each customer

    Gender â€“ Gender of the customer

ðŸ‘‰ Steps Performed
1. Load CSV File using Pandas
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("retail_sales.csv")

2. Data Cleaning & Exploration

    Checked for missing values.
    Reviewed dataset shape & info.
    Basic statistics with df.describe(). & df.info()
    
    df.describe() -> provides a statistical summary of a DataFrame or Series
    df.info() -> used to obtain a concise summary of a DataFrame.

3. Data Analysis
 Total sales by Product category
   âš¡ sales_by_category = df.groupby('Product Category')['Total Amount'].sum()

 Orders By Gender
    âš¡orders_by_gender = df.groupby('Gender')['Transaction ID'].count()

 Top-selling prodeucts by quantity
     âš¡top_products = df.groupby('Product Category')['Quantity'].sum()

4. Data Visualization
    Bar charts for sales & orders distribution
    Pie charts for product category share
    Line charts for sales trends over time

    âš¡sales_by_category.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
    plt.title('Total Sales by Product Category')
    plt.ylabel('Total Sales Amount')
    plt.show()

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Identified top-selling product categories.
Found customer purchasing trends by gender.
